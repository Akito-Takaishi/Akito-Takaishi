    	<h3> Background Information</h3>
      <p>In 2016, Mrs. Calachan along with her friend, Mrs. Moncada started to make a business out of selling putos.
          They started to experiment and explore puto in order to create a product that is healthy and diet-friendly.
          They experimented with kutsinta with kalabasa being its flavor, until the friends finally went with puto, especially puto carrots.
          In the beginning, the products were ordered then made to be delivered house to house.</p>

      <p>When the pandemic struck, the business went and expanded online due to quarantine. The business advertised online through the use of Facebook, with the product being delivered again house to house.
          As the years went, the business became stable with it introducing a new product, NutriPuto, introduced during the early part of 2023.
          The business started to expand more online with it creating and implementing an online ordering system.</p>

    	<p>	PutoExpress started as a project with the motive to widen its reach to its customer. It aims to deliver our healthy and delicious NutriPuto in a fast and efficient way.
          The online ordering system’s motto is “Delivering NutriPuto in a fast way” therefore the name ‘PutoExpress’ was chosen as the name of the online ordering system as it matches
          with the motto and similarly represents the product.</p>
      <p>
        The business started on 2022, which expanded greatly as the latter of the year went on. With five different flavors that customers can choose from, our product NutriPuto,
        introduced in the early part of 2023 became our best seller. To satisfy the customers growing demand, PutoExpress was implemented in order to easily reach and deliver
        NutriPuto to the customers. As 2023 went on, PutoExpress brought more and more customers and sales. With its fast and efficient service, PutoExpress brought customer’s satisfaction
        to high levels.</p>
